## Abstract

Integrated Trust Network (ITN) is a community-built and operated network. The objective is to build a Federated Trust Layer (Core Services) and Business Automation Interoperability Infrastructure (User Agents) for ITN. The ITN Identifier is specified in accordance with the [W3C DID Core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).

ITN Identifier = ITN DID

The syntax of the identifier and accompanying data model used by the protocol is conformant with the [DID-CORE](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) specification and shall be registered with the [DID-SPEC-REGISTRIES](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-spec-registries/).

For a detailed read on DID and other DID method specifications, one can refer [WebOfTrustInfo - DID Primer](https://github.com/WebOfTrustInfo/rwot5-boston/blob/master/topics-and-advance-readings/did-primer.md)

## Architecture Overview

The ITN is a permissioned network of nodes operated by ITN Node Operators.

Each ITN Node is comprised of the following elements depicted in the figure below:

- ITN Agent for Core Services ~ (former name used - Self Sovereign Digital Twin (SSDT) of the Core Services OR Core Services SSDT)
- DLT Gateway: An application integrating with the Core Services SSDT, Apache Kafka, and the different DLT networks of the ITN.
- DID Resolver: The DID resolver utilizes the Decentralized Identity Foundation DID resolver and is integrated with the Core Services SSDT.
- Content Addressable Storage Network: A database with content-addressable hashes and replication between ITN Nodes. Additionally, supports peer-to-peer replication.
- DLT Networks: It is comprised of a Hyperledger Fabric network and Arbitrum One EVM equivalent network (with more to follow, in particular, based on Integrated Trust Network (ITN) expansion).

All applications external to the ITN and wishing to utilize the ITN Core Services must implement an ITN Agent as their abstraction layer. An ITN Agent represents a userâ€™s capabilities on ITN and serves as an abstraction and integration layer between ITN and other applications/networks.

![ITN Architecture Overview](./docs/images/ITN%20Architecture%20Overview.jpg)

The ITN Agent utilized in each ITN node is comprised of the following elements:

- API Endpoint Service for both REST APIs and [Decentralized Identity Foundation (DIF) DIDcomm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/) messaging protocol for integration with ITN Core Services, other Agents, and Legacy Applications via REST APIs
- Authentication service utilizing [OAuth2 for REST APIs](https://oauth.net/2/) and [DIF DID AuthN](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html) for DIF DIDcomm messaging
- An implementation of the [W3C Universal Wallet](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/universal-wallet-interop-spec/) for key and document management
- An implementation of the W3C Verifiable Credential Issuance and Verification standard both as REST APIs and as DIDcomm endpoints
- Implementation of ITN Data Sharing APIs both as REST APIs and as DIDcomm endpoints
- An implementation of ITN Core Services functionality via DIF DIDcomm
- An implementation of the [W3C/DIF Encrypted Data Vault](https://identity.foundation/confidential-storage/) for document storage

ITN Agent Integration can be achieved through an SDK, as utilized by the ITN. ITN Agent is an implementation of the [Aries Agent RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-rfcs/blob/main/concepts/0004-agents/README.md)
with a flexible plugin architecture.

Depending on which plugins and [DIDComm protocols](https://didcomm.org/search/?page=1) you use, your instance of ITN Agent can
perform a variety of roles:

- Create and manage cryptographic keys
- Create and manage Decentralized Identifiers
- Issue and verify Verifiable Credentials (VCs) and Presentations (VPs)
- Communicate with other Agents over [DIDComm](https://identity.foundation/didcomm-messaging/spec/#discover-features-protocol-20)

Agent provides a common interface for plugins to expand its functionality. It is designed to be modular and extensible,
so you can add new protocols, transports, and managers to fit your needs.

## ITN SDK

![ITN_SDK](https://github.com/itn-trust/itn-did-spec/assets/18353464/6135b073-c085-41fd-8ea4-f80e64e0485d)

The ITN SDK provides methods to manage DIDs & DID Documents.

## Conformance

The keywords MAY, MUST, MUST NOT, RECOMMENDED, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT in this document are to be interpreted according to [RFC2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)`

## Terminology

1. Integrated Trust Network (ITN) is a block-chain based, protocol-agnostic, federated network delivering decentralized identity services for a new generation of secure digital commerce. ITN provides decentralized digital infrastructure as the required core trust services of governance, authority, identity, & assurance for multi-party business ecosystems.
2. Encrypted Data Vault (EDV) for document storage.
3. Content Addressable Storage (CAS) is a database with content-addressable hashes and replication between ITN Nodes.
4. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) (also called a distributed ledger or shared ledger) is the consensus of replicated, shared, and synchronized digital data that is geographically spread (distributed) across many sites, countries, or institutions. A distributed ledger requires peer-to-peer network and consensus algorithms to ensure the ledger is reliably replicated across nodes. Blockchains are the most well-known example.
5. Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a globally unique identifier that can be resolved to a DID Document, or de-referenced on a specific distributed ledger network, much like a URL on the Internet.
6. Verifiable Credential (VC) is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build verifiable presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified.
7. Verifiable Presentation (VP) is a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification.

## DID ITN Method Specification

### Format

The ITN DID is derived as follow:

1. A random 32 byte string is generated
2. The seed is hashed using sha512
3. An Ed25519 key pair is generated from the hash. The key pair will be used as the recovery key pair
4. The identifier of the `did:itn` is the first 16 bytes of the recovery key pair's public key encoded into Base58 format.
5. Prefix the generated identifier with `did:itn`

All operations on the DID (update, revoke, recover) are signed by private recovery key and verified by public recovery key. Verification process also includes the DID identifier validation - having the public recovery key, the verifier repeats steps 4 and 5 on his side and makes sure the DID matches the recovery key.

The format of ITN DID conform to the [W3C DID Core specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/). The W3C DID Core specification does not specify how a DID is generated, and leaves it up to the implementation provided it ensures uniqueness to a high degree of confidence.

**Note:** Format section ensures the ITN DID Format complies with [W3C DID Method Syntax](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#method-syntax)

## Security Considerations

- ITN heavily relies on W3C DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers) and VCs (Verifiable Credentials) cryptographic mechanisms and decentralized trust models to mitigate the risks associated with various attacks.
- Authentication service utilizing [OAuth2](https://oauth.net/2/) for REST APIs and [DIF DID AuthN](https://identity.foundation/working-groups/authentication.html) for DIF DIDcomm messaging.
- Authentication is involved, particularly user-host authentication, the security characteristics are those of OAuth2 and DIDCom 2.0.
- Beyond the residual risks specified in the utilized authentication and authorization protocols, there are the normal implementation security risks that should be addressed through a security audit of any implementation.
- ITN DID Method relies on cryptographic protection mechanisms, ensuring that DID AuthN for all endpoints and communication channels and asymmetric encryption for all data.
- Only the private keys are held in secret and that is up to the user to implement. ITN nodes employ the EDV standard for secret securing including Secure Hardware Elements (HSMs).
- Keys are specified in the DID Document in Verification Methods object for various Verification Relationships.

Here's how ITN can prevent the specific attacks outlined:

1. Eavesdropping

ITN DID can facilitate the establishment of secure communication channels between parties by encrypting messages exchanged between DIDs using cryptographic keys defined in the corresponding DID Documents. DIDs and VCs use cryptographic signatures to ensure that communication between parties is encrypted and authenticated. This prevents unauthorized interception and eavesdropping of sensitive information.

2. Replay

Digital signatures utilized between the ITN and a user utilize nonces and DLT transactions on either of the utilized networks utilize both chainIds and account nonces to prevent DLT transaction replays.

3. Message Insertion

Since ITN communication channels are using asymmetric encryption, the only way to insert a message would be to gain access to the private keys used for encryption, DID AuthN, and VC signatures.

4. Deletion

The DLT transactions on the two anchor DLTs cannot be deleted and DID document entries in the CAS can only be deleted by ITN Node Operators. ITN Node Operators are permissioned, and known legal entities. In addition, currently, only three ITN nodes have write permissions into the CAS. Lastly, existing CAS data redundancies make a CAS deletion not practical.

5. Modification

DID anchoring transactions on a DLT cannot be altered once the anchoring transaction is finalized on the respective DLT. CAS DID doc entries could only be maliciously modified by three specific ITN Nodes. Furthermore, data redundancies with rollbacks make modification attacks useless.

6. Denial of Service (DoS)

The ITN can operate as long as one honest node is operational. This means that besides typical (D)DoS protections enterprises utilize, the node redundancies in the network mitigate a DoS attack.

7. Amplification

All DID operations apart from DID creation require DID AuthN. Therefore, each attack on a DID operation endpoint requires a DID and a secure communications channel. Hence, any attacks are limited to that established channel which can be disconnected at any time by an Operator. Lastly, the DID creation operation also requires establishing a secure communications channel which again restricts any attack to that channel, and, therefore, mitigation is as already mentioned. DOSing a channel would lead to a blacklisting of the malicious DID and a new DID would have to be created to perform an attack. Since the network only requires one honestly operating node, attacks by individual nodes would be recognized by other network nodes and access to that node can be easily removed by each node operator in their node, isolating the malicious node. And since network transactions have to be reimbursed to the ITN as an organization, spamming attacks of a compromised node lead to economic damage to the Operator operating the malicious node. This is an economic security guarantee since all Node Operators are known legal entities to which exists legal recourse.

8. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)

Asymmetric encryption of all ITN communication channels ensures a high degree of safety against MitM attacks unless the relevant private keys are compromised.

**Note:** Security Considerations section ensures the ITN DID Method Security considerations comply with [W3C DID Method Security Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#security-requirements)

## Privacy Considerations

ITN is only storing the following data:

- Public Keys in DID documents stored in our CAS, and in Smart Contracts stored on our DLTs
- Hashed data in Smart Contracts on our DLTs representing DID documents, in our CAS for our VC revocation lists, and aggregate application state data
- Service endpoints in DID documents on our CAS

In the ITN context, only Public Keys and Service Endpoints may refer to an individual. ITN ensures proper management in the following way:

1. DID documents may be deleted by their controllers, and, therefore, access to DID documents from the outside by a 3rd party is no longer possible.
2. While public keys and hashes of DID documents remain on the DLTs of the ITN, ITN will not maintain logs of IP addresses that requested ITN service operations, and, therefore, makes the correlation of a public key with personal data (the IP assigned to an individualâ€™s router at a specific physical address by the ISP) from the point of view of the ITN, or an entity breaching the ITN, not possible. However, if a public key is used outside of the context of ITN more than once, then it may be subject to linkability to other personal data.

The reason why within ITN hashed data may be considered sufficiently anonymized is as follows: While hashed data may contain personal data through public keys or service endpoints in the DID documents, it is combined with randomized, non-personal data such as a DID itself, per European Commission (EC) guideline.

**Note:** Privacy Considerations section ensures the ITN DID Method Privacy considerations complies with [W3C DID Method Privacy Requirements](https://w3c.github.io/did-core/#privacy-requirements)
